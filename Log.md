# Log for tracking issues and solutions

## Notes

My approach to harmonising these variables is to go through the physical assessments for each year, starting from antenatal/neonatal
and ensuring that all of the variables enumerated in the assessment for the follow-up are captured/harmonised, and then move on to
the next follow-up, and ensure all the variables from *there* are harmonised, and so on.

- Investigate the protocols per test across follow-ups to determine if the test is technically the same and thus harmonisable
- Blood pressure can vary:
    - resting vs at end of assessment
    - sitting vs. supine

## Actions

- [ ] Add/ensure units of measurement for variable labels for variables like height, weight, head circumference, etc.

## General issues

- Body dysmorphology was harmonised from G201 onwards by John, but not with G200, which Hangfei completed and named variables differently
    - Appears to be two additional options (1-22) in neonatal clinical exam, compared to G201
    -

## Groups/buckets to harmonise

- Anthropometry/Blood Pressure
- Dysmorphology
- Neurological/Neuromuscular
- Spirometry
- Cogstate (G222, G126)
- Extras (like XDAT, XPLA, etc. - the leftover, miscellaneous variables)

## Issues by datasets

### G201

- The dataset contains both Q and PA data: everything from XDAT onwards is PA, except for TT and ASQ variables

### G205

- Height is labelled as "m" but is clearly "cm"
